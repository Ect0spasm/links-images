        <p>This here page be about micellaneous HTML plasms (stuff), 
          you may not or may <em>not</em> <strong>not</strong> be interested in <a href='../links.html'>links</a> or 
          <a href='../images.html'>images</a>.</p>

          <h2>Character Sets</h2>

<p>You can use UTF-8 to count in Turkish:</p>

<ol>
  <li>bir</li>
  <li>iki</li>
  <li>üç</li>
  <li>dört</li>
  <li>beş</li>
  <ul><li>Huh, neat.</li></ul>
</ol>

   those are &lt; &gt;  and &amp;. You should always use HTML 
   entities for these characters three.</p>

        <p> But this one totally is, it's way
          cooler, like a 3D typography of a slice
          of cake or something. I think it's too
          late for me to be coding right now.</p>
